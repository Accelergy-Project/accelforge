    "# Lab 2: Reducing Data Movement using Data Reuse and Optimizing Memory Hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen in Lab 1, actual designs often fall below the roofline model.\n",
    "In this lab, we will see that one reason designs fall below the roofline is because there is almost always more data movement than the theoretical minimum.\n",
    "A key technique to reduce data movement and close the design-to-roofline gap is by leveraging data reuse.\n",
    "In the following sections, we will learn about data reuse, how memory hierarchies and mappings together achieve data reuse, and how to optimize them.\n",
