# Lab 1
Lab 1 and the rest of the labs assume that your Lab 0 is working. If your Lab 0 is not working, please return to Lab 0. If you are having difficulty completing Lab 0, please post on Piazza and/or come to Office Hours. If you are having difficulty with Lab 1 and future labs, please also post on Piazza publicly unless it is a sensitive matter in order to help your classmates with similar issues. In general Piazza will be monitored more than any individual inbox.
