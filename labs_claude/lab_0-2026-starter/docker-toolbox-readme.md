Instructions for docker toolbox installation
----------------------------------------------
System requirements:
 - Windows OS >= 7/8/10 home
 - MacOS >= 10.8 Mountain Lion

### Download Docker
We are going to use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/) app for this lab

Please download the latest release of the docker toolbox [here](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases) 

*Please install it to the default path the installer suggests (*e.g.,* C drive for Windows) to avoid volume mounting issues*
  - You should get a `pkg` file for MAC
  - You should get a `exe` file for Windows  
  
You should see `Docker Quick Start Terminal` and `Kitematic` apps installed.

- Click on the `Docker Quick Start Terminal` icon to start the Docker 
  - if you experience unsuccessful startups:
    - Windows users: *e.g.,* "error while checking if machine default exists", try restart your computer.
    - Mac users: *e.g.,* "error on known virtual box bug", 
       - your OS probably is more compatible with the Docker Desktop App, 
         but you can still fix the installation by following the instructions [here](http://biercoff.com/how-to-fix-docker-machine-installation-on-mac-os-x/)
