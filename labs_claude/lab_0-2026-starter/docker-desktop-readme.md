Instructions for docker desktop installation
----------------------------------------------
System requirements:
 - Windows OS 10 Pro with enterprise/education
 - MacOS >= 10.13 
 
### Download Docker
We are going to use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/) for this lab 
(install it to the default path the installer suggests (*e.g.,* C drive for Windows) to avoid volume mounting issues)

Please download the latest release of the docker app 
  - [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
    - *if there is "error on known virtual box bug" while starting your Docker, please follow the instructions 
      [here](http://biercoff.com/how-to-fix-docker-machine-installation-on-mac-os-x/) to fix*
  - [Windows 10 Pro](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) 
    - *if you have not enabled virtualization in your machine before, please manually 
    [turn on virtualization via BIOS settings](https://2nwiki.2n.cz/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75202968)*
  - After installation, make sure that your Docker app is running by launching it.
