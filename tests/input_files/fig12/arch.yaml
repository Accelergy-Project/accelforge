# EyerissV2 single-PE architecture for fig12 reproduction.
# 6-level hierarchy: BackingStorage → iact_spad / weight_spad / psum_spad → reg → MAC
# ERT values from Accelergy (45nm, Aladdin_table + Cacti estimators).
# BackingStorage: 0 energy (DRAM boundary, not counted at PE level).
# psum_spad: single average energy 0.33633 pJ (Sparseloop uses data-delta-dependent).
