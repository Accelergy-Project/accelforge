AccelForge
==========

AccelForge is a framework to design and model tensor algebra accelerators. It includes
flexible, user-defined specifications for components, architectures, and workloads, and,
given these specifications, quickly finds optimal fused mappings to program the
workloads onto the architectures.

AccelForge is based on multiple other projects. If you use AccelForge in your work,
please refer to :doc:`guide/citation` for how to cite the relevant projects.
