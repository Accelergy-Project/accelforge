# component is a SRAM buffer with an address register that is updated on every
# access to queue up the next data.

# Sometimes, hwcomponents models require additional attributes that are not part of the
# accelforge spec. These can be passed to the component models through the
# extra_attributes_for_component_model field.

# Actions that the hwcomponents_library model must support. All action attributes that
# can are passed to the model's appropriate method (in this case, `read` or `write`).
# The `bits_per_action` argument is special because it determines how many bits are
# transferred by each read or write. Additionally, to pass extra attributes to the
# component model as arguments, actions also have a extra_attributes_for_component_model
# field.

# For many component models, energy and latency are measured per-bit, so bits_per_action
# may be omitted in these cases.
